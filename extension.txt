This extension of the N-Queen program has the following optimizations to make it run faster:
    1. This program uses dynamic queues which occupy only the memory required by the program at any time.
    2. It uses a better backtracking algorithm, which after placing a queen in a row moves to the
    next row without searching the current one to minimize the search space.
    3. It uses bitmasks to search for queens in same row, column and both diagonals, thereby 
    making it faster since it only requires O(1) time as opposed to O(N) time.

Additionally this program also has additional graphical display of solutions. I am using the 
SDL library wrapper provided by Neill in his repo to achieve this.

Instructions to run the program:
1. Run the following commands on the commandline
    - make extension
    - ./extension [-verbose](optional flag) [number of queens]

The -verbose flag will display the solutions in SDL and terminal. The number of solutions and 
original display appear on the terminal while the solutions in graphical form appear in a SDL
window.
